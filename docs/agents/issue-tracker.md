| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Title | `<emoji> [<kind>] <scope>: <what>` · ≤ 70 chars · no ticket number · e.g. `🐛 [bug] receipts: spinner never stops over 10 MB` |
| Context | lettered steps under Where, ONE per line · NEVER arrows · screenshot embedded for UI, NEVER linked |
| Bugs | add `## Evidence`: the folded 12-row table (writing-standard.md § 3) · a missing row says `n/a — why` |
| Acceptance Criteria | 2–5 `- [ ]` lines · each checkable · NEVER "works well", "is fast" |
| Risk | 🟢 Low · 🟡 Medium · 🔴 High + one line |
| Blocked by | `- #N — why` bullets, or a bare `- None.` · NEVER "None — but #N first" |
| Labels | `money`, `auth`, `schema` route the merge to a human (merge_policy) · `schema` = destructive only (DROP/TRUNCATE/RENAME); additive migrations need no label |
| Human-only step | a `needs-you: <command>` line in the PR body → 🙋 Blocked until done |
| Size | one card = one PR under 400 changed lines (`merge_policy.auto_max_lines`) · bigger → split with `/to-tickets` |
