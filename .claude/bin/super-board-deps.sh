#!/usr/bin/env bash
# super-board-deps.sh — work out, for every open issue, whether it can start now.
#
# Two sources, in precedence order:
#   1. the last `blocked-by:` line in the issue's Block comments (what a lane
#      wrote when it most recently parked the card)
#   2. the issue body's `## Blocked by` section (what the ticket was written with)
#
# This is the dependency primitive. The wave planner uses it to size a wave and to
# sweep the Blocked column; anything else that needs to know "what is waiting on
# what" should call this rather than re-parse issue bodies.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE SCRIPT, AND WHY IT IS FUSSY
#
# Parsing this section naively gets it wrong in three ways that were all observed
# on a real board on 2026-08-20:
#
#   1. The preflight banner at the top of every super-board ticket quotes the words
#      "## Blocked by" inside backticks. A parser that takes the FIRST match reads
#      the banner and finds no blockers. This takes the LAST heading-shaped match.
#
#   2. Tickets written by `to-tickets` follow its template, whose example line is
#      `**Blocked by:** … or "None — can start immediately"`. In practice that
#      produced lines like:
#
#          - None — but #26 must be merged first, since this edits the module it builds.
#
#      A human reads one blocker. A parser reads the word "None" and builds it
#      early. Any line that says None AND names an issue is UNPARSEABLE, never
#      "no blockers" — see the fail-safe rule below.
#
#   3. A missing section and an empty section both mean "nothing was written",
#      which is not the same as "nothing blocks this". Both are UNPARSEABLE.
#
# FAIL SAFE, NOT FAIL OPEN. An issue this script cannot read confidently is
# reported `parseable: false` and callers must treat it as blocked. Guessing
# "runnable" on an ambiguous line is how a card gets built against a base branch
# that does not have what it needs yet — one wave saved, one rewrite spent.
#
# Usage:
#   super-board-deps.sh --repo <owner/name> [--issues 12,34] [--from <payload.json>]
#
# Stdout, one object keyed by issue number:
#   { "40": { "number": 40, "title": "…", "state": "OPEN",
#             "blockers": [32,36], "openBlockers": [32],
#             "parseable": true, "humanGated": false, "runnable": false, "why": "",
#             "needsYou": false, "needsYouDone": false } }
#
# `needsYou` — the newest Block comment carries the 🙋 reason tag, or the issue
# has the `needs-you` label: a human-only command is waiting (block-template.md).
# `needsYouDone` — verified by super-board-approval.py: a trusted human replied
# done after a pinned request for the current PR head. Labels are never authority.
# Saved --from payloads stay offline and cannot assert verified human approval.
# A 🙋 card stays humanGated either way — only the resume path moves it.
#
# `runnable` is true only when the line parses, no blocker is still open, AND the
# card is not human-gated. `humanGated` comes from `blocked-by: -`, which means
# "nothing on this board clears it" — credentials, permissions, a product ruling.
# The sweep must never free one of those; only a person can.
