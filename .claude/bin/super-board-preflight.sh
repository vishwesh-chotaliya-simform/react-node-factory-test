# super-board-preflight.sh — before a card goes Ready → Building, is it worth building?
#
# Four questions, asked of every candidate card before any Builder starts:
#
#   1. Already done?        a merged PR closes it, or a merged PR / closed issue carries
#                           the same fingerprint or (near-)same title.
#   2. Already in progress? an open PR from ANOTHER branch closes it or has the same
#                           title, or another card in Building/QA/Review (or a lower-
#                           numbered Ready peer in this wave) has the same title.
#   3. File overlap?        an open PR touches files this card names, or a lower-numbered
#                           card in the same --issues batch names them. Not a duplicate —
#                           a sequencing problem. The card goes behind the issue that
#                           PR closes (blocked-by, so the wave-start sweep frees it when
#                           that issue closes), or, if the PR closes nothing, proceeds
#                           with an expected-conflict note so the merge gate rebases. Two
#                           batch peers: the lower number proceeds, the other is sequenced
#                           `blockedBy: [<lower>]` — never both against each other.
#   4. Unclear?             no `## Acceptance Criteria` section with at least one bullet.
#
# Outcomes: proceed · hold (dup done / dup in progress / unclear) · sequence.
#
# THIS SCRIPT IS THE MECHANICAL HALF. It catches what string matching can catch and
# lists near-misses (`candidates`) for the pre-flight sub-agent, which makes the
# semantic call: "same feature, different words" and "AC contradicts the code" are
# judgements, not regexes. The agent may upgrade proceed → hold on evidence; it may
# downgrade a mechanical hold only by naming why the match is a different feature.
#
# Cheap by construction: the three list calls run ONCE per invocation however many
# issues are checked (pass --issues 12,14,15 to batch a wave), plus one `gh issue
# view` per issue. The worker gh guard runs first when it is installed alongside.
#
# Usage:
#   super-board-preflight.sh --repo <owner/name> --issues <N[,M…]>
#                            [--inflight <cards.json>]   # [{number,title,status}] board cards
#                            [--files a/b.ts,c/d.ts]     # paths the card will touch (else: parsed from body)
#                            [--threshold 0.6]           # title Jaccard for a duplicate
#
# Stdout, one object keyed by issue number:
#   { "14": { "number": 14, "title": "…", "verdict": "proceed|hold|sequence",
#             "tag": "done|in-progress|unclear|overlap|clean", "reason": "…",
#             "evidence": ["#31 merged: Resolves #14"], "blockedBy": [31],
#             "conflictWith": [52], "candidates": [{"ref":"#40","kind":"open-pr","sim":0.4,"title":"…"}] } }
#
# Exit 0 ok · 64 usage · 79 required GitHub evidence unavailable (pause the run;
# a blind pre-flight never says proceed).
