# super-board-wave-plan.sh — compute the next workflow-backend wave from board state.
# Read-only: no gh writes, no locks. The orchestrator owns every mutation; this
# script only says what the next wave should contain and what should be swept.
#
# WAVE SHAPE (changed 2026-08-20 — see "why" below)
#
# A wave is no longer a fixed number of slots. It is:
#
#   every Ready card whose `## Blocked by` list is fully closed,
#   plus every card already in flight in QA or Review,
#   minus anything already claimed by an assignee.
#
# Width therefore follows the dependency graph rather than a tuning knob. On a
# board with 19 free cards the wave is 19; on a board with 2 it is 2. The
# workflow runtime caps *concurrent* agents (min(16, cpus-2)) and queues the
# rest, so dispatching wide costs nothing and finishes sooner.
#
# WHY THE OLD FIXED CAP WAS WRONG, MEASURED. On a real board on 2026-08-20,
# `max_workers` was 7 and 23 of 32 Ready cards were waiting on an open blocker.
# A cap that does not look at dependencies spends its slots on cards that will
# hit their own preflight and park — so it throttled the free cards while doing
# nothing about the blocked ones. Filtering first and then not capping is
# strictly better: fewer wasted dispatches AND more real work per wave.
#
# `max_workers` is kept as a safety valve. Absent or 0 means unlimited, which is
# the default. Set it only to deliberately throttle a machine.
#
# THE BLOCKED SWEEP. `Blocked` used to be terminal: a card parked naming the
# issue it waited on, that issue later closed, and nothing ever read the note
# back. Cards sat until a human noticed — five of them did, on the board above.
# This script now reports, in `sweep`, every Blocked card whose blockers have all
# closed. The orchestrator moves them to Ready before launching, so they join the
# very next wave.
#
# FAIL SAFE ON AN UNREADABLE DEPENDENCY LINE. A card whose `## Blocked by`
# section cannot be parsed confidently is never treated as free. It is reported
# in `flag` so the orchestrator can comment on it, and it is left where it is.
# Guessing "runnable" is how a card gets built against a base branch that does
# not have what it needs. See super-board-deps.sh for what "unreadable" means and
# the three shapes that produce it.
#
# STRANDED BUILDING CARDS. No lane selects from Building: a Builder moves its card
# Ready → Building and on to QA in one lifecycle. A wave stopped (or crashed) in
# between leaves the card in Building, and nothing ever picks it up again. The
# planner runs only between waves, after the crash-recovery sweep has stripped
# leaked claims, so a Building card with no assignee has no live worker. It is
# reported in `stranded`; the orchestrator checks its branch and worktree and
# moves it back to Ready, keeping the branch.
#
# LABEL ROUTING (v3.0.0). One board shape for every project; a card's label picks
# its lane. Three labels: `qa`, `bug`, `feature`. A Ready card labelled `qa` skips
# the Builder and goes straight to the Tester (lane "qa"); every other Ready card,
# labelled or not, is built first (lane "build"). Each picked card carries `lane`
# and its `labels`. The old per-board `variant` is gone: a config still saying
# "qa-only" is refused (exit 65) until `super-board onboard` upgrades it, because
# reading it as "full" would start building on a board meant only for testing.
#
# Usage:
#   super-board-wave-plan.sh --config <config.json> [--items <project-items.json>]
#                            [--deps <deps.json>]
# Without --items, fetches live board state via super-board-card.sh items — the
# item-list shape for ~1 GraphQL point per 100 cards, where `gh project item-list`
# spends 101 per 100 (fieldValues x four nested connections).
# Without --deps, derives the graph via super-board-deps.sh. Pass --deps in tests
# to keep the script offline.
#
# Stdout:
#   { "cards": [ {"number":10,"status":"Review","title":"…","lane":"review","labels":[]} ],
#     "sweep": [ {"number":37,"title":"…","clearedBy":[32]} ],
